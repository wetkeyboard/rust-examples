# Abstract Factory Pattern

This is an example implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern in Rust. The code demonstrates how to use the Abstract Factory pattern to create and manipulate fruits and vegetables.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the following command:

```shell
cargo run
```

This will compile and execute the code, demonstrating the creation and manipulation of fruits and vegetables.

## Code Explanation

The code defines several traits and structs to represent products, fruits, vegetables, and factories. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

- `Product`: The `Product` trait defines the common behavior of all products. It includes methods for harvesting and displaying the product.
- `Fruit`: The `Fruit` trait extends the `Product` trait and represents fruits. It serves as a marker trait for fruit products.
- `Vegetable`: The `Vegetable` trait extends the `Product` trait and represents vegetables. It serves as a marker trait for vegetable products.
- Concrete Implementations: The code provides concrete implementations for specific fruits and vegetables such as `Strawberry`, `Apple`, `Raspberry`, `Onion`, `Carrot`. These implementations define the harvesting and display logic for each product.
- `CreationError`: The `CreationError` enum represents the error cases for creating fruits and vegetables.
- Factory Traits: The `FruitFactory` and `VegetableFactory` traits define the abstract factory interfaces for creating fruits and vegetables, respectively.
- Factory Implementations: The code provides concrete implementations for the fruit and vegetable factories, namely `FruitFarm` and `VegetableFarm`. These factories implement the respective factory traits and handle the creation of specific fruit and vegetable types.
- Usage Example: The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the factories to create and manipulate fruits and vegetables. It showcases the creation of different fruit and vegetable types and invokes the common behavior methods.

## Test

The code includes a test suite that can be executed using the following command:

```shell
cargo test
```

The test suite validates the creation and behavior of fruits and vegetables using the factory implementations.

## Possible Improvements

Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the code:

- Error Handling: The code currently uses a simple `CreationError` enum for error handling during product creation. More robust error handling mechanisms, such as using the `Result` type or custom error types, can be implemented for better error reporting and handling.
- Factory Registry: If the number of product types increases significantly, a factory registry or lookup mechanism could be implemented to handle dynamic factory registration and retrieval.
- Dynamic Product Data: If the products have additional dynamic data beyond the behavior methods, the code can be extended to accommodate and manipulate that data.

Feel free to make any modifications or enhancements based on your specific requirements and preferences.
