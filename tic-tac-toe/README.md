# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Rust. I created it for fun.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. You can build and run the game using the following command:

```shell
cargo run
```

5. Follow the prompts in the terminal to play the game. You can make your moves by entering the position number of the cell you want to mark. The positions are numbered from 1 to 9, corresponding to the cells on the board.

6. Enjoy the game!

## Running Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the game. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
cargo test
```

The test results will be displayed in the terminal.

Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
