## Why?

I created these examples for the sheer fun of exploring Rust and learning more about this excellent programming language.

Feel free to use these examples to learn Rust or as a reference for your own projects. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvement, I'd be happy to receive contributions and feedback.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you have any interesting Rust examples, bug fixes, or enhancements, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and build a collection of useful and educational Rust examples together.
